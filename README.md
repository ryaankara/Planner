# Planner

This Android Studio app will allow users to keep track of their daily tasks.

The design will let the user do the following things:
-Create a new task
-Write an extended description of what their "to-do" is
-Assign their new task to a certain category (whether it be related to school or work)
-Complete the task (in which a check mark will be displayed next to the task)

In addition, this app will highlight the task a certain color which corresponds to the category
that it belongs to so that the user can easily see.
